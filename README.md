# Budget Rails Web App

> Mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what. The RoR application allows the user to:

- [x] Introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- [x] See the money spent on each category.

The result should look similar to the following data model:
